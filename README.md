## Coding Files
### Data Processing
The `split_all_gazepoints.py` file takes the `all_gazepoints_max_invalid_per_subject10%.txt` file
and creates individual gazepoints files for each film.

### Creating Visualisations
`format handcodings.ipynb`, `plot_subject_gaze.ipynb`, and `visualizations.ipynb` all contain
various plots. `format handcodings.ipynb` will create histograms based on the presence of
certain features during a frame. `plot_subject_gaze.ipynb` can generate line plots and scatter
plots of individual subjects' gaze locations over the period of a clip. Finally,
`visualizations.py` contains various small plots for data exploration, and is generally not
important for answering questions about the dataset.

## Visualisations
The generated visualisations will appear in the `lineplots`, `scatterplots`, `histograms`, and
`histograms2` folders.
